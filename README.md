# Pokemon Recommender

This is a Content based Recommender system which recommends pokemon similar to the Input pokemon.

When i found this dataset, I thought it would be great to build a pokemon recommender system since I like Pokemon.
I found this dataset on kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon
And I have built my Recommender system - https://www.kaggle.com/pavantennyson/pokemon-recommender
I am importing the same notebook here

This dataset contains pokemons from first six generations and their stats, including Mega Evolved Pokemon
I'll be using stats and type of pokemon to know similarities between pokemon

I have built two functions in this notebook
* First function just gives similar pokemon as output, Number of pokemon recommendations depends on the number of recommendations given in the function
* Second function has the same functionality as the first function and in addition to this we can filter the output based on pokemon type, Generation etc..
