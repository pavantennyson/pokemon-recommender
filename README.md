# Pokemon Recommender

This is a Content based Recommender system which recommends pokemon similar to the Input pokemon.

When i found this dataset, I thought it would be great to build a pokemon recommender system since I like Pokemon.<br>
I found this dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon)<br>
And I have built my [Recommender system](https://www.kaggle.com/pavantennyson/pokemon-recommender)<br>
I am importing the same notebook here<br>

This dataset contains pokemons from first six generations and their stats, including Mega Evolved Pokemon<br>
I'll be using stats and type of pokemon to know similarities between pokemon<br>

I have built two functions in this notebook
* First function just gives similar pokemon as output, Number of pokemon recommendations depends on the number of recommendations given in the function
* Second function has the same functionality as the first function and in addition to this we can filter the output based on pokemon type, Generation etc..
